**GatorLUG** is a Linux User Group located in **Gainesville, Florida**. The 
purpose of
the group is education, support and advocacy for open source, open data formats,
and open communication standards.

We meet the **third Wednesday** of each month. Most meetings are held at a place
where food and drinks are available. The meeting announcement will always list
the physical location of the meeting. If we have to cancel or change a meeting
time it will be announced in advance on this website and posted to
[LINUX-L@LISTS.UFL.EDU](http://lists.ufl.edu/archives/linux-l.html).

The meeting time will be **6pm** unless we have announced a change. We'll do our
best to keep the meeting time and place as consistent as possible. All regular
monthly meetings will have an agenda posted to this website and announced on the
LINUX-L list. You are welcome to **come early**, get a bite to eat and socialize
before the presentation starts. Meetings will officially finish by 8pm - that's
the goal anyway.

You can often find some of us hanging out on our official IRC channel:
`irc.freenode.net #gatorlug`

Meetings are free and open to the public.
