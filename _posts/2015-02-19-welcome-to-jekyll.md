You are invited to join us at the next GatorLUG meeting in Gainesville, Florida. 
This month will be a social meeting at [The Bull](http://thebulldowntown.com/).

Due to scheduling conflicts, we were unable to secure some of the venues we 
discussed last month, so join us for a social meeting while we discuss other 
meeting locations, talk about Linux, and enjoy some libations.

The Bull is a bar serving craft beer and wine, as well as soft-drinks and a good 
selection of tea and coffee. It's also a meeting place, a gallery, a music 
venue, a special events venue.

Hope to see you there!
